        <h3>Team Change</h3>
        <p>So some of you who know our team knows that we are not a rookie team. URSA Major has been around for many years, known to many as URSA Major 13632. Due to a change in mentorship and STEM programs at our school; we had to create a new team. We have decided to keep the team name as URSA Major, but our number has changed to 22774. This upcoming season of 2023-2024 will be co-led by Sohan and Duke who have both had only 1 year of experience in FTC due to the mass majority of our team last year being seniors. This is why this website won't be complete for very long for we are learning this as we go along. It has become a summer project for our 2 captains along with many other tasks to make URSA Major 22774 competitive in the 2023-2024 season year with many rookie teammates.</p>
